    <descript>
      <abstract>State Volstead Lands mapped to the PLS forty level. This layer merges the DNR Control Point Generated PLS layer with IBM mainframe-based land records. The data are limited to a forty level resolution. Therefore, holdings that are less than a forty in extent are represented as a full forty in the data (although specific fields exist within the attribute tables that allow the user to identify these). Detailed discussion on the issues associated with the application of this data can be found at: http://intranet.dnr.state.mn.us/mis/gis/pdf/landrecords_read.pdf</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide Minnesota DNR resource managers and land records specialists access to State Volstead Lands information in GIS format.</purpose>

    <overview>
      <eaover>Data Elements for Attribute Table ADM_ALLLNDPY3.DBF:

COUN:  County identified using a 2-digit number from 1 to 87.

TOWN:  PLS township number.  If the township number ends with ".5", it is the half township - 58.5, range 17.

RANG:  PLS range number

SECT:  PLS section number

GLOT:  PLS government lot number

PARC:  Parcel number - currently not used.  The original intent of this field was to use this code in relation to the forty or government lot to identify unique parcels.

FORT_DESC:  PLS forty (quarter-quarter) description using text.  The descriptions should be read in the following way: NWNE is the Northwest 1/4 of the Northeast 1/4.

GSEQKY:  The Land Records sequence number, a primary key in the Land Records.

DNRDOCNO:  DNR document number

CTYDOCNO:  County Document number.

LCTPIN:  County PIN number

LACRES:  The number of acres that have a State-owned interest within the PLS forty or government covered by this record.

LPCT40:  The percent of the surface area of the PLS forty or government lot that is state owned.  LPCT40 = LACRES/(GLO acres for the forty or government lot) * 100.  If the number is less than 100, this record does not include the entire forty or government lot.

LSFOWN:  State surface ownership.

LSRPCT:  Surface undivided interest given as a percentage.

LMINOW:  State owned mineral interest

LMINPCT:  Mineral undivided interest given as a percentage.

LINTAQ:  Type of ownership interest as a 1-character code.

XINTAQ:  Type of ownership interest as a text description.

LLNDTP:  Land type as a 1-character code.

XLNDTP:  Land type as a text description.

LMNSAQ:  Means of acquisition as a 1-character code.

XMNSAQ:  Means of acquisition as a text description.

PUADMNAME:  DNR public use administrator name.

PUPGM:  DNR public use administrator program as a 3-character code.

PUPGMNAME:  DNR public use administrator program name.

PUPRJ:  DNR public use administrator project code as a 5-digit number. 

PUPJNAME:  DNR public use administrator program/project name.

LADMIN:  DNR administrator code as a 2-digit number.

LMGPGM:  DNR administrator management program as a 3-character code.

LMGPRJ:  DNR administrator program/project as an 8-character code.

CHGDATE:  Land Record change date, given as MM/DD/YYYY.  Indicates when the record was added or last changed.

DOWNLOAD:  Download date - the date when the record was downloaded from the Land Records and matched to PLS40

RDIR:  PLS Range direction as a number, 0, 1, or 2, rather than West, East, West - half township or half range

GLTMCH:  The geocoding field used to match the Land Records to the PLS40 base layer.  The format of this field is as follows:  CCTTTDRRSSFFGG, where CC is COUN, TTT is TOWN, D is RDIR, RR is RANG, SS is SECT, FF is FORT or "00" (see following note), and GG is GLOT.  Note:  if the GLOT is greater than 0, such as government lot 1, the FF part of GLOTMATCH is set to 00. 

GEOSECT:  A PLS description to the section level.  It is a combination of the COUN, TOWN, RDIR, RANG, and SECT fields.  The format of this field is as follows:  CCTTTDRRSS, where CC is COUN, TTT is TOWN, D is RDIR, and SS is SECT.

GEORANG:  A PLS description to the township and range level.  It is a combination of the COUN, TOWN, RDIR, and RANG fields.  The format of this field is as follows:  CCTTTDRR, where CC is COUN, TTT is TOWN, D is RDIR, and RR is RANG.

COUNTXT:  The county name.

FORT:  PLS forty number (that is, the quarter-quarter section), rather than a text description such as NWNE.  (FORT is based on the MLMIS40 codes that have been used in the state for many years.)  In cases where there is a government lot, the FORT code provides a locational reference to where the government lot can be found in the section.

TOWNDIR:  PLS township direction listed as N - North.

RANGDIR:  PLS Range direction where W - West and E - East.

LFORTY:  An old, Bureau of Real Estate Management Land Records code for PLS forties - intended for internal use only.  Generally matches the FORT field (which is LMAP40 in the Land Records), but there are additional values for fractional forties and references to other information.

LTRAN_NUM:  Transaction number, listed as six characters.

LCHGYR:  Land Record added or last changed - year, given as a 4-digit number.

LCHGMN:  Land Record added or changed - month, given as a 2-digit number.

LCHGDY:  Land Record added or last changed - day, given as a 2-digit number.

XMGPRJ:  DNR administrator program/project name.

XMGPGM:  DNR administrator program name.

XADMIN:  DNR administrator name.

PUPRGRPJ:  DNR public use administrator program/project code as a combination of PUPGM and PUPRJ fields.

PUADMIN:  DNR public use administrator as a 2-digit code.  In several locations around the state, there is more than one DNR administrator.  The PUADMIN field indicates the designated administrator of the public use and is used for determining payment-in-liew of taxes (PILT).

LREGIN:  DNR Region as a 1-digit number.

LARDST:  DNR Region area (field unit) code.

LTRAN_TYP:  Transaction type, given as a 2-character code.

LACQDT:  Acquisition date given as a number in the following format:  YYYYMMDD where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, and DD is the 2-digit day.

XACQDT:  Acquisition date given as a text field, formatted as follows:  MM/DD/YYYY, where MM is month, DD is day, and YYYY is year.

LDOCTP:  DNR Document type as a 1-character code.  Refer to the XDOCTP field in the dataset for a list of the text descriptions for document type.

XDOCTP:  DNR document type as a text description.
