    <descript>
      <abstract>This layer contains small scale cartographic representations of Interstates, Federal Trunk Highways, and State Trunk Highways, most of which are found in the Mn/DOT Basemap.  In contrast to that data, this layer represents each highway centerline pair with a single line, thereby simplifying labeling and identification.  The features have also been simplified in that where highways from different systems are coincident, they were consolidated into a single representation following a hierarchy of Interstates, then Federal Trunk Highways, and then State Trunk Highways.  For example, where US Highway 10 is coincident with Interstate 35W, only one segment exists and it is identified only as Interstate 35W.

In some rare cases, county roads were included where they were natural extensions of existing state highways.</abstract>

    <!--<logic>Attributes follow a consistent hierarchy of Interstates, Federal Trunk Highways, and State Trunk Highways where coincident road systems exist.  In three records where more than one interstate coincide, the following choices were made:
I694 and I35E: Labeled I35E
I94 and I35W: Labeled I94
I94 and I35E: Labeled I94
While topological rules were used to create this hierarchy, the dataset has not been reviewed for topological consistency.</logic>-->
    <complete>This data set generally does not include county roads, CSAH's, ramps, or other features that can be typically included with Major Roads layers. To make up for gaps created by these omissions, the linework has been generalized in some locations.</complete>
