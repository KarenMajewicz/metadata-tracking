      <abstract>This raster dataset is a detailed (1-acre minimum), hierarchically organized vegetation cover map produced by computer classification of combined two-season pairs of early-1990s Landsat 4/5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, as part of the Upper Midwest Gap Analysis Program (UMGAP)(http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/umgaphome.html) of the U.S. Geological Survey.  Units of analysis were Minnesota Ecological Classification System (ECS)(http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ecs/index.html) subsections subdivided by TM scenes.  GAP typology and classification protocols are closely comparable across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.</abstract>
      <purpose>The dataset was created for use in the Geological Survey's Gap Analysis Program (GAP)(http://gapanalysis.nbii.gov/) , a national project aimed at prioritizing lands for conservation action.  Other uses include stratification of inventories, land use planning, and spatial analysis of landscape patterns.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Statewide. Processed by units as shown at the following link:  GAP Processing Unit Map(http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us:8080/gis/ancillary/gap_unit_map.gif)</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Source table LULC_GAP1ARA3.VAT:  Minnesota GAP vegetation information is presented at four levels, from the most detailed (Level 4) to the most highly aggregated (Level 1).  In each processing unit, accuracy figures have been calculated for every type at each level of the classification hierarchy.  Percentage accuracy attributes at all four levels are attached to every data element, as indicated in the Attribute Table(http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us/gis/ancillary/type_description6.htm).  (Types too sparsely represented for accuracy assessment have an accuracy attribute of -1.)  Class definitions and accuracy tabulations can be found, along with an explanation of accuracy assessment methods, at the following link: Minnesota GAP Accuracy Assessment(http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us:8080/gis/ancillary/accuracy_table.htm).

    <logic>Not all cover types exist as mappable units in all ECS subsections of the state.  Some types omitted from classification in a given subsection may be classified in an adjacent subsection.  This, or other circumstances, may give rise to type mismatches across subsection boundaries.</logic>
    <complete>The existing vegetation of the entire state, with emphasis on forests, has been mapped to a single standard by use of closely comparable satellite image sets and a consistent classification protocol.  The product closely resembles GAP vegetation coverages in Wisconsin and Michigan.</complete>

        <procdesc>Attribute Lineage for source table LULC_GAP1ARA3.VAT:  Early discussion between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and cooperators in a projected Gap Analysis Program covering Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan assumed that the desired vegetation layer would be produced by computer analysis of seven-band, 30-meter Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images at a minimum mapping acreage of 100 ha (250 ac), and that the classification would be correspondingly coarse--at about the second level of the U.S. Geological Survey land use/cover class system (Anderson et al. 1976).  When the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources put forward its WISCLAND classification as an alternative, it was also considered a &amp;quot;Level II&amp;quot; scheme. WISCLAND sought to map land cover across Wisconsin at the 5-acre (2 ha) level of detail by multiseason TM image analysis together with wetlands,  topographic and roads data (Lillesand 1993).  Later it became clear that a more detailed physiognomic and floristic typology was wanted for GAP (Jennings1993)--at the &amp;quot;community type&amp;quot; level of the UNESCO vegetation class system (Driscoll et al.1984).  State remote sensing specialists responded by expanding the WISCLAND scheme to the highest level of vegetational detail they considered mappable from two well-timed scene dates together with ancillary data.  The result was the typology used in Minnesota GAP.
