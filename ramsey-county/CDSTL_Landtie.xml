These are lines with hooked ends that help define parcel ownership on maps.  In 1986, Parcel Information [MAPINFO] data was digitized from hand drawn 1:2400 half and 1:1200 quarter section maps.  In 1995, the map information data layer was converted to ArcINFO format and maintained in an ArcStorm data base.  Parcel Information was converted in 2005 to an ESRI Arc GIS GeoDatabase format.  In 2014, Landties were seperated out from the other Parcel Information data.

Parcel Information data is rarely computed utilizing coordinate geometry programs.  Most of this information is a visual representation of map features.
</abstract><purpose> The landtie data layer represents graphical elements, which aid in the understanding and interpretation of map features.  It is not intended to be inclusive. It is intended to act as a visual aid to help with map interpretation.  This data is primarily used in map creation.  Features held in this database are utilized by automated half and quarter section map production. </purpose><supplinf>Ramsey County</supplinf></descript><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Monthly</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-93.228202</westbc><eastbc>-92.982974 </eastbc><northbc>45.124277</northbc><southbc>44.890922</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekey>County, Ramsey, Parcel, Tax, landties</themekey></theme></keywords><accconst>None.</accconst><useconst>None.
