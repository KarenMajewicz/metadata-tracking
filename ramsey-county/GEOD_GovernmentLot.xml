      <abstract>This data set contains polygons that represent Government Lots. In 1986, parcel polygons [PARPOLY] were digitized from hand drawn 1:2400 half and 1:1200 quarter section maps. In 1995, the parcel data layer was converted to ArcINFO format and held in the ArcStorm database. Parcel polygons were converted in 2005 to an ESRI ArcGIS SDE GeoDatabase; the name was changed to Parcel Components. In 2014, Ramsey County migrated to ESRI's Parcel Fabric; Government Lots were created from the Parcel Components. 

</abstract>
      <purpose>The Government Lots in this data set support many functions including thematic mapping, asset management, property assessment, surveying and engineering projects.</purpose>

      <procstep>This layer contains a vector representation of bridges and overpasses.  Color aerial photography and airborne GPS used for aerotriangulation.  Aerotrianglution solution used with analytical and softcopy stereo plotters to collect limited planimetric feature.  LIDAR DEM provide by Ramsey County under separate contract with Waggoner Inc. of Jackson, Mississippi was used to create digital ortho images.
